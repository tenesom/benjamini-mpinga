Hi, I'm Benjamini Mpinga. A humble human being, passionate at learning and knowledge shearing, i am a Bible student and a teacher, all times learner of multiple programming language, a lawyer, a husband and a father.

I have dedicated my life to serve God and community at large, my ambition is always to do non harm, wish non harm and be an advocate of Justice and Truth. apart from my professional, learner and a Bible teacher. I am also skilled in Swahili, English and French language.

May Lord God bless us all, and give us a wisdom to know and understand his purpose to create us and allow us to live here on earth, b/coz as long as we live, we are not successful, until the day we die and carry our success to the graves in peace.
