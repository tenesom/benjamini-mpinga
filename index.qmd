Hi, I'm Benjamini Mpinga. A humble human being, passionate to learn and sharing knowledge, i am a student and a teacher in different area of experience and professional, skilled in programming language, husband and a father.

I dedicate my life to serve God and community, committed to do non harm, wish non harm and be an advocate of Justice and Truth. Skilled in Legal matter as well as Swahili, English and French language.

May Lord God bless us all with a wisdom to know and understand his purpose of creation and our lives here on earth, as long as we live, we are not successful, until the day we die and carry our success to His glory of peace.

 OPTIMIST FOR THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.
