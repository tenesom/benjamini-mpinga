### Axe and Forest.

An axes entered to a forest and made friendship with tree's steam, for an axes was very brave to deceived the tree that, My handle is made up by one of your own. The trees believed and hosted an axes, believing that it's one of theirs.

Then an axes started its goal of cutting down the forest, leaves and branches kept striking but the steam kept quite, for the ground that an axes handle were made by one of their own. Until the forest was finished.

**Moral of the story.**

A divided community shall get use by the civilized community, betrayal on the bases of our differences, is as dangerous enemy than death.

loss of human potential = lack of motivation + lack of responsibilty
