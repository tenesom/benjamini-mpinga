For that reason, a tree accepted and supported an axes, deceived that it's one of theirs. Then an axe started its goal of cutting down the tree, roots, leaves and branches kept striking, but the stem kept quite. Believing at the end, they will benefit out of an axe's plans. Until a forest was finished, no handle was made out of the tree's steams.

### Deception

Deception is not a total lies, but it is a technique of mixing Truth and era. So it is very difficult to set-aside small things that are mixed together. For example, it is difficult to set-aside some milks and some water when already mixed. Same applies to deception, when someone mixes truth and era then the only chance remains is either to reject it or accept it.

### Divission 

Imagine a tree as one and complete, but still can be divided, on the ground of its differences of its parts, what about a human being ?. With our many differences, from Tribes to nationality, our education level to our social classes. There many grounds can be used to divide people than a tree.

A tree has been always accepted division on the bases of its parts differences, for that reason a tree will never be safe from anyone of the mentioned group here bellow. Because everyone of them destabilize the tree's nature, either by weaken it or by destroying it.

- A vegetarian sees leaves of a tree as vegetables, so the branch part is very important to him.
- A dietitian sees fruits, the same to him branches are most important part.
- A carpenter sees a wood on tree's stem, so the steam is very important part to him.
- A Herbal doctor sees a medicine in tree's roots and backs so roots and backs are very important part to him.

### Moral of the story.

A divided community shall get use by the civilized community, betrayal or sabotage on any kind of ground, is as dangerous enemy than death, because death is the only true and permanent enemy that always wins, and its power is on dividing people.

We must remain one united people out of diversity and together out of our self interest. lack of motivation + lack of responsibility = loss of human potential.
