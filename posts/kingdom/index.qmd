### Abdu's Trics.

Abdul went to a kingdom of fools, after staying for sometimes, he wanted to show up their foolishness, then he made a small cage of a dove size, then he announced to his friend that **"This cage i made, is the house of an Angle."** Then his friends asked **"How is it going to happen? and how can the Angle fit to that small cage.?"** Abdul replied **"Whoever that sins, will never see the Angle, only holly people can see the Angle."** 

Days passed and time came for the day that Abdul gathered his friends to see the Angel, then he opened a cage and shouted to his friends "Do you see the Angel inside the cage.?" For being ashamed to be seen sinners by others, everyone in the crowd shouted **"Absolutely Yes, i can see how beautiful the Angel is."** But in reality is then there were no Angel in the cage. Then after some days the story reached to a Palace, then the Almighty King invited Abdul to the palace to celebrate his achievement.

After the invitation Abdul promised the King that, **"On the day of celebration i will bring you a gift from Angel. Angel promised to make a Robe special for the King, but only holly people can see that Robe, sinners can never see a Robe."** Then the day came and everyone gathered before the palace to wait and see the Robe from an Angel.

After sometimes of waiting, Abdul came with empty hands, and as he was arriving he shouted **"Live long our might King, You are the most blessed parson to deserve a gift from Angel. Look, here in my hands is the beautiful Robe for you King. Angel has made it him self for you, so please, take of your Robe and please ware this Holly Robe, so that you can reign forever."**

Then everyone started to sing and praise, then the King took his Robe off, and pretending to see the Robe in Abdul's hands, he received and started to ware as if it is the real thing, unfortunately everyone among the crowd pretended to see the Robe, though there was no Robe. So the King was naked and members of the crowd deceived themselves that the King is not naked.

**Wisdom.**

Then a wise man stood back of the crowd sow that the King was naked, he came forward and say **"Your Majesty the living King, why staying naked before your people.? This will put your wisdom into question when you will be sitting to judge people before whom you stayed naked."**

Then the King knowing that he is naked, but don't want to be regarded as a sinner, he replied **"For that reason we have gathered here to know who is a wicked parson in our land, because the promise says, whoever can not the the Robe is a wicked parson."** Then the crowd shouted **"He's the wicked parson in the land, therefor he must executed by the King himself."** 

Before his execution Abdul went to see him in palace cells, then the wise man asked Abdul, **"Why did you do a shameful event in our land.? and why did you ashamed our King publicly.?"** Then Abdul replied gently **"I know that in every society there must be a wise parson, the problem is that their voices can never be heard, because they always act wise. Therefor i came to you not to set you free but to tell you a last lesson you can teach others before you die. And the lesson you should write is..

**Moral of the story.**

***("Being honest and truthful in a corrupt society is difficult, because When the government is wrong, being right is suicide because In a republic of fool it is wrong to Act wise, and in the Land of ........... don't open your both Eyes", )."***
