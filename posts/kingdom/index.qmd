### Abdu's Trics.

Abdul ventured into a kingdom filled with foolish individuals. After spending some time there, he grew determined to expose their lack of wisdom. With a cunning plan in mind, he crafted a miniature cage resembling that of a dove's size. Excitedly, he shared his creation with a close friend, proclaiming it to be the abode of an angel. Puzzled, his friend inquired about the logistics of fitting an angel within such a small enclosure.

Abdul responded with a clever retort, stating that only those who led virtuous lives and remained pure of heart could behold the angel's presence. Those who succumbed to sin and folly would forever remain oblivious to its divine existence

As the days passed, Abdul decided it was time to gather his friends and put his plan into action. With great anticipation, he opened the cage and called out to his companions, asking if they could see the angel inside. Fearing judgment from their peers and not wanting to be perceived as sinners, each person in the crowd enthusiastically declared, "Yes, I can see the beautiful angel clearly!" However, the truth was that there was no angel residing within the cage. The story of Abdul's feat spread, eventually reaching the ears of the Almighty King, who was intrigued by his cunning demonstration.

Impressed by Abdul's ingenuity, the King extended an invitation for him to come to the palace and celebrate his achievement. Thrilled by this opportunity, Abdul gladly accepted the invitation. However, he made a new promise to the King, stating that on the day of the celebration, he would present a gift from the angel—a special robe. He emphasized that only those who were pure of heart and virtuous would be able to see the robe, while sinners would remain unaware of its existence.

The much-anticipated day arrived, and a crowd gathered before the palace in anticipation of witnessing the angel's gift. After a period of waiting, Abdul appeared before the gathering, empty-handed. With enthusiasm and reverence, he hailed the King and proclaimed, "Long live our mighty King, the most blessed among us all.

Today, I bring you a magnificent robe from the angel. Behold, in my hands, I hold this sacred garment. Please, remove your current robe and don this holy attire. May you reign forever, our glorious King." In response, the crowd erupted in jubilant praise for the King, while he willingly removed his robe and pretended to see the non-existent angelic garment in Abdul's hands. Deceived by their own desire to please the King and the fear of being seen as fools, everyone present joined in the pretense, claiming to witness the splendid robe. Thus, the King stood naked, unaware of his exposed state, while the members of the crowd deceived themselves into believing in the presence of the robe.

### Wisdom.

As a wise man stood at the back of the crowd and observed the King's nakedness, he couldn't stay silent any longer. Stepping forward, he addressed the King with respect and concern, saying, "Your Majesty, our esteemed ruler, why do you choose to remain exposed before the eyes of your people? Such an act may cast doubt on your wisdom, particularly when you preside over matters of judgment."

Knowing the truth of his nudity but unwilling to be perceived as a sinner by his subjects, the King responded with a clever defense. He stated, "We have gathered here precisely to identify the wicked individuals in our land, as the promise declares that only those who cannot see the robe are wicked." The crowd immediately reacted, proclaiming, "He is the wicked man in our land! The King himself must execute him!"

Before the execution took place, Abdul visited the wise man in the palace cells. The wise man, still perplexed and deeply affected by the shameful event that unfolded in their land, questioned Abdul, "Why did you orchestrate such a disgraceful act in our kingdom? And why did you publicly humiliate our King?"

In a gentle manner, Abdul responded, "One thing I have come to understand is that every society needs the presence of wise individuals. However, their voices often go unheard because they consistently act with wisdom. This is why I have come to you—not to set you free, but to impart upon you one final lesson that you may carry with you before your impending demise."

### Abdul's remarks to a wise man.

In a kingdom of fools it's false to act wise. 
The challenges of being honest and truthful in a corrupt society. It is indeed a difficult endeavor, especially when confronted with a government or authority that is unwilling to acknowledge its own wrongdoings. In such circumstances, speaking out and standing up for what is right can often lead to severe consequences, figuratively described as "suicide."

Furthermore, this statement emphasizes that in a society where foolishness prevails and wisdom is disregarded, any attempt to act wisely or showcase intelligence is met with resistance and can result in personal downfall. The environment you describe, a republic of fools, implies a system in which the majority are lacking in wisdom and critical thinking, making it challenging for individuals who possess these qualities to thrive or effect meaningful change.

This thought-provoking perspective highlights the importance of fostering a society that values truth, honesty, and wisdom, where individuals can express their insights without fear of retribution or negative consequences.
