Days passed, then time came when Abdul gathered his friends to see the Angel, then he opened a cage and shouted to his friends "Do you see the Angel inside the cage?" For being ashamed to be seen sinners by others, everyone in the crowd shouted **"Absolutely Yes, i can see how beautiful the Angel is."** But in reality there were no Angel in the cage. Then after some days the story reached to a Palace, then the Almighty King invited Abdul to the palace to celebrate his achievement.

After the invitation Abdul promised the King that, **"On the day of celebration i will bring you a gift from Angel. Angel promised to make a special Robe for the King, but only holly people can see that Robe, sinners can never see the Robe."** therefore a day came when everyone gathered before the palace t0 see the Robe from Angel.

After sometimes of waiting, Abdul came with an empty hands, and as he was arriving he shouted **"Live long our might King, You are the most blessed person, so you deserve a gift from an Angel. Look, here in my hands is a beautiful Robe for you our mighty King. So please, take of your Robe and please ware this Holly Robe, reign forever. reign our King"**

Everyone sang a praise for the King wile a King took his Robe off, and pretending to see the Robe in Abdul's hands, he received and started to ware as if it was the real thing, unfortunately everyone among the crowd pretend to see the Robe, though there was no Robe. So the King was naked and members of the crowd deceived themselves that the King is not naked.

### Wisdom.

Then a wise man stood back of the crowd saw that the King is naked, he came forward and say **"Your Majesty our living King, why staying naked in the eyes of all your people?. This will put your wisdom into question, when you will be sitting on the judgement chair."**

The King with truth in his heart that he is naked, but don't want to be regarded as a sinner by his people, he replied to a wise man, **"For that reason we have gathered here to know who is a wicked person in our land, because the promise says, whoever can not see the Robe is a wicked person."** Then the crowd shouted **"He's the wicked man in the land, therefore he must be executed by the King him self."** 

Before the  execution, Abdul went to see him in a palace cells, then the wise man asked Abdul, **"Why did you do a shameful event in our land?. and why did you ashamed our King publicly?."** Then Abdul replied gently, **"One thing i know is for sure, that in every society there must be a wise person, the problem is that, their voices can never be heard, because they always act wise. That is why i came to you not to set you free, but to tell you a last lesson you can rest with it Before you die.
