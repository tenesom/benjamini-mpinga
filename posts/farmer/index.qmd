A farmer went to the wildness to hunt, and he captured non incubated Eagle egg, and a monkey, he decided to bring an egg to his chicken farm to incubate it. and leashed the monkey to his home garden. The time passed and both an Egg was incubated and hatched and produced an Eagle....and the monkey grew to a big size.

Then there was a day when a animal expert came to visit his farm, and he saw an eagle chick, then he said to the owner, "This is not a chicken is an eagle chick." Then the owner replied, "No, i picked when it was steel an eagle's egg, then was hatched through a chicken, and i feed it in a chicken farm for too long, it is now a chicken." 

Then the expert went on and say, "Even this monkey, can never stay here fo so long, because it will miss the Forrest." the owner replied "No, while ago was difficult to keep it here, but since i have leashed it even if i unleash today it will never go back to the forest."

Then the expert left the field, many years passed, then one day he came back to see the progress, when he attentively looked at the farm he didn't see an eagle, then he asked "Where is that eagle converted to a chicken.?" The owner replied, "It flew sometimes back and it never came back." He kept asking, "And where is the lite monkey i saw last time.?" The owner replied "There is a day i went out to hunt then suddenly it it jumped on the tall tree with its rob leashed."

Then the expert said to him, I told you "No matter how long you will keep an eagle, it will never loose its Eagle hood. The same to a monkey, you can take a monkey out from the forest, but you can never take a forest out from a monkey's mind."
