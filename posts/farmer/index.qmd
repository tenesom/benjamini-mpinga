### An Eagle in achicken field.

The farmer ventured into the wilderness for hunting and stumbled upon an unincubated eagle's egg. Along with that, he managed to capture a small monkey. With the intention of incubating the egg, he brought it back to his chicken farm, while keeping the monkey leashed in his home garden. As time passed, the egg hatched into a young eagle, and the monkey grew considerably in size. One day, a veterinary expert visited the farm and noticed the presence of an eagle chick. Upon observing it, the expert informed the owner, "This is not a chicken; it is an eagle chick." In response, the owner asserted,

"No, I obtained it when it was still an egg and it hatched alongside my chickens. I have raised and nourished it in the chicken farm for a significant period of time, so now it is a chicken." Upon seeing the monkey, the expert inquired, "How long has this monkey been in your garden? Monkeys are meant to be in the forest, and they tend to miss it." The owner responded, "Initially, it was challenging to keep the monkey here, but over time, it has become accustomed to this place. Even if I were to unleash it today, it would never return to the forest." The expert remained silent and after completing his duties, he left the farm.

Many years passed, and one day the expert returned to assess the farm's progress. As he carefully surveyed the area, he couldn't spot the eagle chick that had transformed into a chicken. Perplexed, he inquired, "Where is that eagle that turned into a chicken?" The owner replied, "One morning, it took flight and never returned." Continuing his questions, the expert asked, "And what about the little monkey I saw last time?" The owner replied, "There was a day when I went out to hunt, and suddenly it leaped onto a tall tree with its leash still attached. It never came back."

### You replace the nature.

The expert responded to the owner, saying, "I had previously mentioned that no matter how long you keep an eagle, it will never lose its true nature as an eagle. The same applies to a monkey. You may remove a monkey from the forest, but you can never erase the forest from its instincts and behavior."

### Moral of the story.

The moral of the story is that just because you find yourself in a place where you appear to fit in, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is where you truly belong. In life, you may reach a stage where you feel comfortable and think you have fulfilled your purpose, but that may not be your ultimate destination or where you can truly accomplish your potential. True destination and fulfillment come from achieving meaningful goals and embracing responsibility and motivation. Failing to do so can result in a loss of human potential.
