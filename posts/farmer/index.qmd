### An Eagle in achicken field.

A farmer went to the wildness to hunt, and he found non incubated Eagle's egg, he also captured a very little monkey, he decided to bring an egg to his chicken farm to incubate it, and leashed the monkey to his home garden. The time passed and an Egg was hatched and the monkey grew to a big size. Then there was a day when a veterinary expert came to visit his farm, and he saw an eagle chick, then the expert said to the owner, "This is not a chicken is an eagle chick." Then the owner replied, "No, i picked when it was still an egg, then was hatched through my chicken, and i feed it in a chicken farm for too long, it is now a chicken."

The expert saw a monkey as well and said, "how long this monkey is in your garden?, because monkey will miss the Forrest." the owner replied "No, long ago was difficult to keep it, but since i has stayed here fo this long, even if i unleash today, will never go back to the forest." The expert stayed quite and after he done with his duties he left the field,

Many years passed, then one day he came back to see the progress of the farm, when he attentively looked at the farm he didn't see which was then an eagle chick, then he asked "Where is that eagle converted to a chicken.?" The owner replied, "One day morning it flew and and never came back." He kept asking, "And what about the lite monkey i saw last time.?" The owner replied "There was a day i went out to hunt then suddenly it jumped on the tall tree with its rob leashed and never came back."

### You can't keep every animal

Then the expert said to him, I told you "No matter how long you will keep an eagle, it will never loose its Eagle hood. The same to a monkey, you can take a monkey out from the forest, but you can never take a forest out from a monkey's mind."

### Comfort zone

Moral of the story
An eagle chick could stay with chicken in a farm, as well as a Monkey can stay in a house garden, but being where you fit does't mean is where you belong.

**Not everywhere you seem fit, is where you belong**, in life you may reach a stage and fee you have already finish your purpose, but often it is not our manifested destination, but because the stage provides comfort, then we don't want to leave. Destination is not what we achieve it is what we Accomplish. lack of motivation + lack of responsibility = loss of human potential.
