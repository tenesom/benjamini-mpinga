The cowboy embarked on a journey alongside his trusty horse, venturing out in search of a valuable treasure. Throughout his expedition, he braved the challenges of crossing mountains, rivers, deserts, and shrublands. However, as he neared his destination, he encountered a dense forest. Realizing the limited visibility due to the towering trees, he made the decision to turn back and patiently await the conclusion of the rain. His intention was to wait for the forest to dry up, enabling him to have a clearer view of the surroundings and facilitate his progress.

Pausing for a moment to ponder his options, the cowboy ultimately resolved to return home. Just as he was retracing his steps, his horse inquired, "Where are we headed, and why are we turning back?" The cowboy responded, "We must go back because the thick forest limits my visibility, and I can't see far ahead." Curious, the horse posed another question, "Can you see your next step, though?" "Yes, I can," the cowboy affirmed. In turn, the horse advised him, "Then concentrate on each step you can perceive rather than fixating solely on your final destination."

### Power of the process

It is crucial to emphasize the significance of the immediate step that lies before you. Placing your focus on what you are certain of, rather than solely relying on anticipated outcomes, is a more reliable approach. Expectations often lead to disappointment, while embracing the process brings comfort.

In life, we frequently fixate on reaching our ultimate destination, disregarding the value of the journey itself. As we approach the threshold of success, we may encounter formidable obstacles. Instead of confronting these challenges with a fresh strategy, we often choose to start anew, seeking alternative paths. The wisdom imparted by the Horse reminds us that true success lies in finding joy throughout the journey, rather than fixating solely on the final destination.
