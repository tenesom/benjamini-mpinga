### Cowboys's Horse.

A cowboy went to a journey with his horse, he went out to collect a treasury, he crossed mountains and rivers, deserts and shrub land. As he was continue with his trip, very close to reach his destination, he had to cross the thick forest before, as he was at the mid of the forest, himself and his horse. He decided to go back and wait until the rain is over so that the Forrest may turn dry, and will be easy to see far. because of the tall trees he couldn't see very far from where he stood.

He stooped for sometimes to sort out what to do, then he decided to get back to where he came from, as he was turning back the horse, then A Horse ask his master a question, **"Where are we going, why are you turning back.?"** the master replied **"We must go back because i can't see very far, the forest is thick."** then the Horse asked him **"Can you see your next step.?"** **"Yes i can"** he replied. Then the horse said to him **"Then focus on your next step you can see, instead of your destination."**

**Moral of the story.**

In life we often focus on the destination instead of focusing on the journey, we mostly reach very close to our success destination, but because along the way we find a great obstacle, we tend mostly to start over with another way, instead of facing the obstacle with a different strategy. We are taught by the Horse if we want to succeed whatever mission we have, then we should **focus and enjoy the journey rather than the destination.**
