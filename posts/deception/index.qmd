The oracle of Apollo delivered a chilling prediction that the King's son would commit the unthinkable act of killing his own father and marrying his own mother.

The wisdom of these individuals was often tested through their ability to solve complex riddles, as a testament to their intelligence and intellectual As the Phidias arrived at the King's palace, his brilliance and royal lineage allowed him to partake in the riddle-solving, proving himself to be as wise as the late King himself.

However, the stakes were unexpectedly raised when it was declared that the victor of the riddle challenge would be rewarded with marriage to the Queen. Unaware that the Queen was his own mother, the wife of the deceased King, he passionately pursued the victory. In his oath, he proclaimed that whoever discovered the truth behind the King's murder would face exile from the land. Tragically, the Oracles proclaimed him to be the murder, sealing his fate as an outcast, banished from the land. On the day of his departure, a profound lesson about the consequences of one's actions remained throughout the age.
