**Procedures**

Tamisemi Procedures to follow when a public servant seek to shift from one Municipal to another Municipal. Here below are the current steps a public servant should get prepared to go through during the process.

The process are usual performed by the Local Government officials, this means a public servant must initiate the process, and after the submission of document at **DED'S OFFICE**, then the public servant has no roll to intervene the process until it's done.

If the process follows its regulations may take a bit while, this is due to government process server, mainly government usually uses Posters to deliver its documents, since the process is done manual.

**ADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS**

Firstly, the current process is absolutely fit to the government's concept of preserving its documents. Preservation of government's document is very important in order to avoid linkage of classified information. Therefor the Public Servant's information is of one of the very important document to both government and Servant.

Secondly, the current process offers great chance to the Government's department to measure and crosscheck the validity and legality of the process, this method helps officials not to work under pressure of pushing things without close observation.

Thirdly, the current process support the system of governance to keep working normal while it's in execution. this helps to not frustrate the working shifts at work palaces, as well as extra cost that can be spend by the Public servant during the process.

Fourthly, the current process cutoff corruption attempt during the process, because the document shall go under the very systematic stages before its approval, during this process no one can absolutely know who to deal with or who to cooperate with to speedup of maneuver the process.

Fifthly, the process saves government's money (Public Servant's Transfer payment), since the Servant shall bear the whole transfer expenses him/her self.

**A figure above shows the current shifting process.**

**DESCRIPTIONS.**

**Step 1.**

As we can see the above chart, the process begins with the **"Request latter for a vacancy"** from a public servant to a **DED** of the Municipal he/she want to go, but this latter must pass through Medical officer In charge **(MOI)**, District Medical Officer **(DMO**)and District Executive Director **(DED)** of his/her current work station, for authorization.

**Step 2.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of his/her current work station, shall authorize the latter and send it to the **DED** of the Municipal that the public servant want to go and that latter shall go through Medical officer In charge **(DMO)** of that new Municipal for confirmation of vacancy in health department.

**Step 3.**

**DED** of the Municipal that the public servant want to go, shall confirm request latter and write a confirmation latter and shall be sent to a public servant through his/her **DED** for further procedures.

**Step 4.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of his/her current work station shall write to a Regional Administration Secretary **(RAS),** to notify the provision of a vacancy as well as asking to proceed the process to the Ministry **(TAMISEMI)**, after that, the **Ras** office shall write to Tamisemi's Cabinet Secretary **(CS)** to approve the process.

**Step 5.**

**CS** for Tamisemi shall approve and send the letter to **CS** responsible for PUBLIC SERVICE for Execution. And after the process done at Utumishi, **UTUMISHI CS** shall send the Permission latter to both **Public servant** and Municipal Council through **DED** of the current working station.

**Step 6.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of his/her current work station shall, write a **permission latter to a public servant to permit him/her to move to the new work station (NEW MUNICIPAL),** and attach that latter with the latter from **Utumishi's CS** that shows the requirement to be done soon after reporting to a new Municipal.

**Step 7.**

The last step is the Public servant report to the New working station, this is done after receiving the permission latter from Both Utumishi and DED. Soon after his/her report the public servant is required to inform the **Utumishi CS** through **New Municipal** **DED**, that he/she has already report.

**DISADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS.**

-   **Time and material cost;** this is due to fact that a public servant need to bear some material cost when shifting even if sometimes there are genuine reasons for his/her request.

-   **Bureaucracy;** this is due to fact that, the latter fo permission to shift is passing through people's hands, so it is possible to be blocked somewhere within a chain of process.

-   **Cheating;** this is due to fact that , there no roll a public servant can play legally to speed up the process, so some unfaithful servant within the administration can make some deliberate mistake to frustrate/sabot the process.

-   **Less efficiency;** this is due to fact that, a public servant must concentrate much of his/her time to seek feedback of for followup of his/her request, this reduces concentration to work.

**PROPOSAL**

Although there are many advantages and some disadvantages on the current shifting process, there few things must be taken into consideration as we move forward, we must put in place some useful measures to improve the current system.

1.  **Integrate online system:** this method can improve the system in many ways such as, Unnecessary delay of report, Cost during the process, simplifying the feedback to both A public servant as well as Municipal authority, Easy method to be accessed by the whole chain in government sectors. This type of system will also reduces the possibility of lost of document during the process.
2.  **Discourage personal choice:** the current method allows a public servant to seek a vacancy directly to a specific Municipal, but sometimes this may cause one to cooperate with another administrator to get chance in that Municipal , here is when you can smell the corruption rumors. So to tackle this i suggest that, Tamisemi after reception of a shifting latter from RAC office, it must play a roll to decide as follow.

**PROPOSED PROCEDURES**.

Every public servant shall be required to have a Government service account accessible via his/her cheque number, employee account shall be accessible by both all above authorities of the Local Government Ministry **From Servant to CS,** and a servant shall use that account for three main reasons.

-   To file Leave letters

-   To claim servant's rights at work as well as social security services.

-   To file transfer and shift letters and similar reports.

Therefore every letter together with all necessary attachment shall be filled **online** through that employee account, and it will be accessible by **MOI**, **DMO** and **DED**. After all mention authorities approve the form then a servant shall push that form to **TAMISEMI** through **RAS** office for determination of mentioned grounds for transfer/shift.

This process will allow a servant to followup the progress of his/her request directly and if any query/comment will be raise from the above authority, a servant will be able to answer or fulfill whatever has been raised through the same platform. This process will end the age of lamentation and doubt from many public servants.

When a servant request for a vacancy, shall propose three Municipal he/she wants to shift to, then shall be a roll of **TAMISEMI** to decide the Municipal to where a servant shall go. this is due to fact that, some of Municipal have insufficiency workers while others have enough and sometimes excess.

Tamisemi shall directly notify a New Municipal DED on the shifting process of a servant, as well as determine weather it is reasonable to pay for his or her shift.

Online submission shall make transparent to the whole system of Government, and during the process every part shall be able to track where the process is being slowed or

  C -- 3rd --> D[(CS</br>UTUMISHI)]
  D -- 4TH --> A
